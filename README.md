## ! Notes

Set 'Security -> SecureBootModel' to 'Disabled' (case sensitive) during installation. Once you are up and running, you can set it back to 'Default'.

Whatevergeen was causing blackscreen after verbose logs, so I switched to NootRX and it performs much better compared to Whatevergeen.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Changing Serial Number, Board Serial Number, and SmUUID

To use iMessage and other Apple services, you need to generate your own serial numbers. This can be done using [Hackintool](https://github.com/benbaker76/Hackintool). Go to the ‚ÄúSerial‚Äú tab and make sure model is set to MacPro. Use the barcode-with-apple button to check your generated serial numbers. If the website tells you that the serial number isn't valid, everything is fine. Otherwise, you have to generate a new set.

Next you will have to copy the following values from Hackintool to your config.plist:
- Serial Number -> Root/PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemSerialNumber
- Board Number -> Root/PlatformInfo/Generic/MLB
- SmUUID -> Root/PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemUUID

Reboot and Apple services should work.

If they don't, follow [this in-depth guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html). It goes deeper into ROM, clearing NVRAM, clearing Keychain (missing this step might cause major issues), and much more.
